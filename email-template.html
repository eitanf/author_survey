<p dir="ltr">Dear Dr. ${m://LastName},</p>
&nbsp;

<p dir="ltr">My name is Eitan Frachtenberg, and I&rsquo;m a visiting professor of computer science at Reed College. My team is currently investigating the peer-review process of computer science conferences, particularly in the systems area. The goal of the study is to identify and understand variations in the peer review-process among different conferences, and some of their effects on the author&rsquo;s experience.</p>
